# pointer_flutterv5
 Flutter project of the Pointer Technologies app

This is the closest thing to a final product for the tracker prototype our team had made.
It is fully-functional, except for the tracker setup functionality. Our team decided to make the codebase, for both the Flutter and Java (Android Studio), public to serve as assistance to anyone starting their own big-scale project.

It consists of:
- A sign in screen
- A register screen
- The main screen, that consists of devices the user has added
- The "add device" screen
- A setup screen (more about it in the Arduino repository: )

All of it is integrated with a real-time database, for which Firebase was used.

**We try to update the components to the latest stable version and get rid of deprecated classes.**
